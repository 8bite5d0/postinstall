# postinstall

Bash Script to automate post-installation steps.
Helps to install packages on different operating systems.


## Overview

`postinstall.sh` is simple bash shell script which in turn generates scripts.
The generation depends on the operating system and type of installation.
The templates that are included in the generation can be stored in the file system or on a web server.
This can also be your GitHub repository.
Just fork this repository and edit it according to your needs.

`postinstall.sh` is not a configuration management system.
If you want to install many servers automatically, you should look at [ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible).
But if you want to quickly reinstall your laptop or Raspberry Pi, `postinstall.sh` can help you.

* Check package manager and requirements
* Generate script to run before and after installation and list of packages to install
* Install packages


## Requirements

Only `bash`, `curl` and a package manager for the respective operating system:

* Cygwin  ‚Üí `apt-cyg`
* Debian  ‚Üí `apt-get`
* FreeBSD ‚Üí `pkg`
* macOS   ‚Üí `port` or `brew`
* Red Hat ‚Üí `dnf` or `yum`
