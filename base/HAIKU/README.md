# Haiku

Haiku is a free and open-source operating system compatible with the now discontinued BeOS.

As of September 2013, Haiku includes a package management system called "Haiku Depot,"
enabling software to be compiled into dependency tracking compressed packages.

## Using Package Management

`pkgman` is a package management tool for Haiku.

It is already installed in the standard. You do not have to do anything.
