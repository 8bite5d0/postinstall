# Cygwin

Cygwin has no package manager in the standard installation. 

You must install a package manager.

## Using apt-cyg for Binary Package Management

apt-cyg is a simple script. To install:

	curl -L -k rawgit.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg > apt-cyg
	install apt-cyg /bin

In addition to `curl`, you must also have `wget` installed.
